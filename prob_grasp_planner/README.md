# Probablistic Multi-fingered Grasp Planner

This repo has several learning-based multi-fingered grasp planners implemented. 
We proposed multiple machine leanring models to predict the probability of grasp success from visual information of the object and grasp configuration. 
We then formulated grasp planning as inferring the grasp configuration which maximizes the probability of grasp success inside the grasp prediction deep networks. 

## Requirement 
ROS Kinetic, Python 2.7, Tensorflow 1.13.1, scikit-learn 0.20.3, PCL 1.7.2, OpenCV. 

## Build
```catkin build prob_grasp_planner```
